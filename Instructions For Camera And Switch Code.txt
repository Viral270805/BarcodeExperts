How to Run the Code:

1.Install Required Libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install RPLCD picamera gpiozero pyzbar pillow
   ```

2. Save the code to a file, e.g., `lcdandcam.py`.

3.Run the Code:
   ```bash
  lcdandcam.py
   ```

### Workflow:

1. **Database Creation**:
   - When the program runs, it creates the `items.db` database with the `items` table if it doesn't already exist.

2. **QR Code Scanning**:
   - The system displays "Scan QR Code" on the LCD.
   - When a QR code is scanned, it looks up the corresponding `item_name` in the database.

3. **Item Confirmation**:
   - If the item is found, it displays the item name and waits for user input:
     - **Short press**: Confirms the item.
     - **Long press**: Rescans the QR code.
   - If the item is not found, it displays "Item not found".

4. **Rescanning**:
   - If no QR code is detected, it displays "No QR Code found" and waits for another scan.
